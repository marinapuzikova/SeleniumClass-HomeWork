*********************Selenium Review 05 *****************

TASK 1:
1.goto http://hrm.syntaxtechs.net/humanresources/symfony/web/index.php/dashboard
2. Enter user name and wrong password
3.Hit the login Button
4.take screen shot

guide lines:
create
1.Base class--> Open and close browser method
2.utils-->common methods
it will have the methods to
a. send keys
b. take screen shot
3.page --> all the needed elements of the login page
" use with page factory to intialize all elements"
HINT
@Findby (id='txtusername')
public WebElement username;
don't forget to initialize by calling constructor:)



--------------------------------
1. baseclass --> open and close browser methods
2.commonMethods--> commonly used methods
3.pages -->locate all the elements that we need to use

				we have two methods we can implement to locate the elements
				1.the old one we already know driver.findElements(By.id());
				2.using page factory annotations.

				----pageFactory
				1.@FindBy-->annotation
				   @FindBy(id="txtusername")          ----->public Webelement userName=driver.Findelement(By.id("txtusername"))
				   public webElement userName;        ----->

				2.--->call the constructor to initalize all the elements
				public  loginwithpagefactory(){

					PageFactory.initElements(driver,this);
				}
4.test--> loginPageTest


Task2--->>>>>

task 3--> goto admin page and find a specific user
1.create a new test --> adminpagetest
1.1 the admin btn element is going to be inside the dashboard page class
2.Adminpage--> all the element of admin page



----------------Window Handles--------------
**what is a window handle?
a unique alphanumeric id

** is there any difference in a window and a tab when we look from selenium persepective?
No, selenium treats a new tab similar to a new window

**If we open up 5 windows, is there any way of nowing that which one was opened before??
No, we donto know which window was open before

**can we possibly know that which window handle belongs to which particular window by index???
No we  can not!!!!!!!

*getwindowHandle ---> it returns us the id or handle of the current window on which the focus of selenium is

*getwindowHandles-- >it returns us all the windows handles that are there!!!!

*switchTo.defualtcontent()-->switch the focus to the main/ home page


and to switch focus to any other page we use
driver.switchTo.Windows(handle);



*****to switch to one of the desried windows****
1.get all the handles  -->returned to us in an unordered set
2.We will iterate the whole set and move through each handle one by one
3.switch to each handle and check if it is the desired one ----> "in an if condition check for the title or the url"
  yes--> break out
  no--> conitnue to loop through and check
